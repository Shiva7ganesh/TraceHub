## How It Works
1. **Post Found Items**: Users can post details and photos of found items. These posts are held in a temporary collection.
2. **Admin Approval**: The admin reviews found item posts. Once approved, the items are moved to the main collection for all users to see.
3. **Report Lost Items**: Users can submit reports for lost items and browse the found items list.
